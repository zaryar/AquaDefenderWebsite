    <h2>About us</h2>
    <div class="mechanic">
      <p>In our development team, we have organised ourselves via GitHub to work on new functions. We created issues to track specific tasks and improvements. These issues served as a central point of contact for discussions, planning and tracking our progress.
        <br> We met once a week to discuss features. We also played the game ourselves a lot to make sure it was fun to play.
        For the final polish, we let friends play the game and listened to feet feedback on what we could do better.</p>
